A System Level Cache (SLC) is a shared cache that sits between multiple processor clusters (or cores) and the main memory (DRAM). It serves as a last-level cache — typically L3 or L4, depending on the system architecture — and is used to reduce memory access latency and bandwidth pressure on the DRAM.

🧩 Hierarchy Overview

A typical cache hierarchy in a modern SoC looks like:

Core → L1 (private) → L2 (private/shared) → SLC → DRAM


L1 Cache: Closest to the core, very fast but small.

L2 Cache: Larger and slower than L1, often per core or shared by a small cluster.

System Level Cache (SLC): Shared across multiple cores, GPUs, and accelerators.

DRAM: Large but slow main memory.

⚙️ Key Characteristics

Shared Resource:

Used by all CPU clusters and possibly other agents (like GPU, ISP, DSP, NPU).

Helps reduce redundant memory accesses and improves inter-processor data sharing.

Coherency Support:

Maintains cache coherency across different cores and agents, often using protocols like ACE or CHI (in ARM architectures).

Ensures consistent data view across all caches in the system.

Performance Boost:

Reduces average memory access time.

Lowers DRAM bandwidth usage by servicing requests from the SLC.

Power Efficiency:

Accessing SLC consumes less power than accessing DRAM.

Reduces off-chip memory traffic, saving energy.

🏗️ In ARM Systems

In ARM-based SoCs (like those using Cortex-A clusters):

The System Level Cache Controller (SLC or SLC-400/500) is connected via CCI (Cache Coherent Interconnect) or CMN (Coherent Mesh Network).

It provides shared caching and coherence between CPU clusters and other coherent agents.

Example:

Cortex-A77 Cluster ─┬──┐
                    │  │
GPU / NPU ──────────┘  │
                       │
                   System Level Cache (SLC)
                       │
                     DRAM
