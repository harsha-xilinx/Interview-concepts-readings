3 Phase:
IDLE Phase: PSEL->0, PENABLE ->0
SETUP Phase: PSEL->1, PENABLE ->  
When PSEL ->1, PADDR, PWRITE, PWDATA must be valid  (for write transfer).
ACCESS Phase: PSEL->1, PENABLE ->1

PENABLE must get asserted immediately next clk cycle to when PADDR, PSEL and PWRITE was asserted.


APB3 Signal list:
PCLK, PADDR, PWRITE, PSELx, PWDATA, PRDATA, PENABLE, PREADY, PSLVERR
PSELx -> individual peripheral select lines.
PENABLE: to control when data transfer is performed.
PSLVERR -> TO SIGNAL ERROR

WRITE TRANSFER
++++++++++++++++

WRITE TRANSFER are of 2 types: with WAIT state, without WAIT state
How many minimum PCLK cycle, you need in APB protocol to transfer data ? -> 2 PCLK cycles. -> Taking case when at Clk T-> [SEL goes high and in next clk cycle  PEN goes high and in same we have PREADY high, this means data will be transferred here.

Once PEN is high, PREADY goes high immediately, then its a without WAIT state.
Once PEN is high, PREADY goes high after some clk cycles, then its a  WAIT state.

++++++++++++++++
READ TRANSFER
++++++++++++++++
READ TRANSFER are of 2 types: with WAIT state, without WAIT state
PWRITE ->0 , read transfer

In both cases PSLVERR should be looked into, when PSEL and PEN and PREADY are high

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY WITH APB2
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
AMBA 2 APB does not support the PREADY and PSLVERR signals
APB2 subordinates cannot insert wait states
APB2 subordinate cannot return an error response.

IF CONNECTING and APB3 INTERCONNECT TO AN APB2 SUBORDINATE:
THE INTEGRATOR CAN TIE OFF PREADY=1 AND PSLVERR=0 at the interconnect
Zero wait state, no error response
