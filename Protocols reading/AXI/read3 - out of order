2. What does “Out-of-Order” mean?
In AXI, transactions are issued by the master and responded to by the slave.

In-order transaction: The responses come back in the same order as they were issued.
Example: If Master sends T1 → T2 → T3, the slave responds T1 → T2 → T3.

Out-of-order transaction: The responses can come back in a different order than they were issued.
Example: Master sends T1 → T2 → T3, but slave responds T2 → T1 → T3.

So, out-of-order means that the completion order of transactions is not necessarily the same as the issue order.

AXI Ordering Rules
++++++++++++++++++++++++
AXI doesn’t allow arbitrary reordering for all transactions. There are rules:
a) ID-Based Ordering
Every transaction has an ID (AxID).
Ordering is guaranteed only per ID.
For a given ID, the slave must return responses in the order issued.
For transactions with different IDs, out-of-order responses are allowed.

Examples:
Write transactions: B responses can come back in a different order if they have different IDs.
Read transactions: R responses can come back out-of-order for different IDs.

why WID is eradicated from AXI4?
++++++++++++++++++++++
Why WID Was Removed in AXI4 (Compared to AXI3)
In AXI3, the WID (Write ID) signal existed on the W channel.
In AXI4, WID was completely removed.
Reason 1: AXI4 enforces in-order write data for each ID
In AXI3, the protocol allowed write data beats to arrive out-of-order, so the slave needed WID to know which write transaction each WDATA beat belonged to.
Example in AXI3:
AW ID = 3
AW ID = 7

WDATA for ID 7 could arrive before WDATA for ID 3
➡️ Slave needs WID to match data to the correct transaction.

In AXI4, this flexibility is removed:
For each AWID, write data must follow in the exact same order as the AW transaction issued.
Write data cannot be interleaved on the W channel
Because ordering is fixed, the slave always knows:
“The next WDATA belongs to the most recently accepted AW transaction that has outstanding beats.”
Thus, no need for WID.

Reason 2: Simplifies interconnect and slave design
Removing WID removes complexity in:
Routing write data for different IDs
Reordering buffers
Merging or scheduling WDATA based on IDs
Handling interleaved bursts
This significantly reduces:
Gate count
Power
Verification complexity
Timing closure effort
