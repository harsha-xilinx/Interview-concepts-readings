CHI is an extension of ACE protocol
AXI (AMBA AXI4)
	•	Designed for high-performance, high-bandwidth memory-mapped communication between processors, memory, and peripherals.
	•	Supports:
	•	Multiple outstanding transactions
	•	Out-of-order completion
	•	Burst transfers
But: AXI is non-coherent — it doesn’t handle cache coherence between multiple masters.

✅ Used in:
SoCs with single master or software-managed coherence (e.g., microcontrollers, simple multicore CPUs).

ACE (AXI Coherency Extensions)

To support hardware cache coherency, ARM added ACE on top of AXI.
	•	Introduced snoop channels to maintain coherence across CPU caches.
	•	Added:
	•	AC (Address Channel)
	•	CR (Snoop Request)
	•	CD (Snoop Data)
	•	R / W channels with coherence attributes.

⚙️ 2. Problem — ACE Was Great, But Limited for SoC Scale-Up
When ARM moved from mobile CPUs to server-class, HPC, and AI accelerators, SoC complexity exploded.
ACE’s design — built around point-to-point snooping — became inefficient.

👉 In short:
AXI/ACE were great for on-chip coherent CPU clusters,
but not for multi-cluster, multi-socket coherent systems.


⚡ 3. Solution — CHI (Coherent Hub Interface)
ARM introduced CHI to overcome these scalability and efficiency limits.
CHI = Coherent Hub Interface
A packet-based, credit-controlled, fully coherent interconnect protocol for high-performance, multi-cluster SoCs.

There are currently seven issues of the CHI protocol: A to G.

What is difference between Fully coherent, IO coherent and IO Coherent with dvm Support
+++++++++++===============
A fully coherent agent participates completely in the system’s cache coherency protocol — just like a CPU.

It can:
	•	Issue coherent requests (reads/writes that snoop other caches)
	•	Respond to snoop requests
	•	Hold dirty data in its cache hierarchy
	•	Participate in DVM (Distributed Virtual Memory) transactions (TLB invalidations, maintenance ops)

✅ Examples:
	•	ARM Cortex-A CPUs
	•	Coherent GPU clusters (in integrated SoCs)
	•	L2 cache coherent accelerators (like ARM’s CMN-based ML engines)

(B) I/O Coherent

💡 Definition

An I/O coherent agent (like a DMA or PCIe device) does not maintain its own cache,
but can access data that might be cached in CPU caches coherently — i.e., it can snoop CPU caches via the interconnect.

It means:
	•	The I/O device doesn’t keep cachelines.
	•	But the interconnect snoops CPU caches on behalf of the device to ensure data consistency.

✅ Example:
A DMA engine reading data that a CPU has in cache.

C) I/O Coherent with DVM Support

💡 Definition

This extends I/O coherency by adding Distributed Virtual Memory (DVM) awareness —
meaning the I/O device also participates in address space management and TLB maintenance.

DVM = Distributed Virtual Memory
→ A mechanism that synchronizes translation structures (TLBs, page tables, ASIDs) across agents in the system
