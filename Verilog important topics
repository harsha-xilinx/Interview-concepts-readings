in below verilog code:
always @(posedge clk)  //always block1 
    x = y; 

always @(posedge clk) // always block 2 
    z = m; 

which will execute first ?

✅ Both blocks are triggered at the SAME time, and
❗ Verilog does NOT define which one executes first.
✔ Correct answer: The order is UNDEFINED.

Verilog's event scheduler places both blocks in the active region for posedge clk.
When multiple always blocks are sensitive to the same event, they can be executed in any order, and that order:
Is NOT specified by the language
Can differ between simulators
Can differ between simulation runs
Cannot be relied upon

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
in below verilog code:
always @(posedge clk)  //always block1 
   #5; x = y;  

always @(posedge clk) // always block 2 
    z = m; 

which will execute first ?

Short answer:
⭐ Block 2 will execute first. Long answer with explanation below.
✔ Why Block 2 executes first

Step-by-step event scheduler behavior:
🟩 1. posedge clk happens → both blocks are triggered
Both always @ (posedge clk) blocks enter the Active Region.

🟩 2. Verilog starts executing Block 1
Inside Block 1:
#5;x = y;
The first statement is a delay (#5).
A delay moves execution of the rest of the block into a future event,
NOT continuing inside Active Region.
So:At time T, Block 1 reaches #5,
It suspends execution,
And schedules the remaining statement (x = y) at time T + 5.
So Block 1 does NOT execute x = y now.

🟩 3. Block 2 executes immediately
Block 2 has no delay:
z = m;   // runs immediately in Active Region

So at time T, Block 2 finishes completely.
🟩 4. After 5 time units (time = T + 5)
Block 1 wakes up and executes:
x = y;
⭐ Final Execution Order (Timeline)
Time = T (posedge clk):
Block 1 starts → hits #5, suspends
Block 2 executes completely → z = m
Time = T + 5:
3. Block 1 resumes → x = y

⭐ Final Answer
Time	What happens
T	Block 2 executes first → z = m
T + 5	Block 1 executes → x = y

So:✔ Block 2 executes first
because Block 1 is delayed by #5 before doing x = y.

what is difference between Code1 and code2

Code1:
always@(posedge clk)
x=y;

always@(posedge clk)
z=m;

Code2:
always@(posedge clk)
begin
x=y;
z=m;
end

Code1:
✔ Meaning:
Two separate sequential processes
Both triggered by posedge clk
Both update their variables on each clock edge
❗ Order between the two blocks is NOT defined
Verilog does not specify which block runs first.

⭐ Code 2 — One Always Block
✔ Meaning:
One sequential process
Triggered by posedge clk
Statements execute in fixed order (x=y executes first, then z=m)

⭐ Do they generate the same hardware?
✔ Yes — if the signals are independent

| Aspect                  | Code 1                         | Code 2                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Number of always blocks | 2                              | 1                                |
| Execution order         | **Undefined**                  | **Fixed: x=y first, z=m second** |
| Risk of race            | Possible (if dependent)        | None                             |
| Synthesized hardware    | Same (for independent x and z) | Same                             |

⭐ Final Conclusion
Functionally and for synthesis, Code1 and Code2 are the same because x and z are independent.
But Code2 is safer and deterministic.
Because all related registers are updated inside the same clocked always block.
If you'd like, I can show cases where Code1 gives wrong results but Code2 works correctly.

in below verilog code:
always @(posedge clk)  //always block1 
    x <= y; 

always @(posedge clk) // always block 2 
    z <= m; 

⭐ Which always block executes first?
✔ Both blocks are triggered at the same time.
✔ Their execution order is NOT defined by Verilog.
✔ Either block may execute first.
That’s the correct answer.
⭐ But here is the important part:
Because you are using non-blocking assignments (<=), the execution order does NOT matter.
Why?
⭐ How non-blocking (<=) works
When the simulator hits:
x <= y; or z <= m;
it does not update x or z immediately.
Instead:
The RHS (y or m) is evaluated now
The LHS update (x or z) is scheduled for later (NBA region)
So both of these go into the NBA queue, regardless of which block executed first.

what is difference between Code1 and code2
Code1:
always@(posedge clk)
x<=y;
always@(posedge clk)
z<=m;

Code2:
always@(posedge clk)
begin
x<=y;
z<=m;
end

Here is the precise and correct difference between Code1 and Code2.

⭐ Code 1 — Two clocked always blocks
always @(posedge clk)
    x <= y;
always @(posedge clk)
    z <= m;

✔ Meaning
Two separate sequential processes
Both triggered by the same posedge clk
Both execute in the NBA region (non-blocking)
❗ Execution order is undefined
Verilog does not guarantee whether block1 or block2 is simulated first.
✔ But result is always correct
Because <= (non-blocking) schedules updates later, execution order does not affect final values.
✔ Synthesizes to:
One flip-flop for x
One flip-flop for z

⭐ Code 2 — One clocked always block
always @(posedge clk) begin
    x <= y;
    z <= m;
end

✔ Meaning
One sequential process
Statements run in fixed order: x<=y first, then z<=m
But because both are <=, they still update together in NBA region
✔ Synthesizes to:
Same flip-flop for x
Same flip-flop for z

⭐ Functional Comparison
Aspect	Code 1	Code 2
| Aspect                      | Code 1                         | Code 2    |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------- |
| # always blocks             | 2                              | 1         |
| Execution order             | **Undefined**                  | **Fixed** |
| Updates done in NBA region? | ✔ Yes                          | ✔ Yes     |
| Race possible?              | ❌ No (because RHS independent) | ❌ No      |
| Synthesized hardware        | **Same**                       | **Same**  |

⭐ Final Answer

Code1 and Code2 generate exactly the same hardware and behave the same,
because:
Both use non-blocking assignments
RHS signals (y and m) are independent
Updates happen in the NBA region simultaneously
The only difference:
Code1 uses two processes with undefined execution order
Code2 uses one process with defined ordering (but irrelevant because of <=)

Question: What hardware is synthesized from:
assign x = y;
Answer:A combinational wire from y to x. No flip-flop.

⭐ 8. Blocking vs Non-blocking trick
Question: Inside one always block:
always @(posedge clk) begin
    a = b;
    c <= a;
end

What does c get?
Answer: c gets the old value of a, NOT the new one.
Explanation
a = b executes in Active region → immediate update
But c <= a is evaluated using old a, because NBA region always uses old values.
This is one of the most frequent interview traps.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1️⃣ Two always blocks, same clock, non-blocking assignment
Question:always @(posedge clk)
    x <= y;
always @(posedge clk)
    z <= x;

Assume y = 5 at this clock edge. What value will z get after the clock?

Answer
z gets the old value of x, not 5.
Why?

Non-blocking assignments (<=) update at the end of the time-step, in the NBA region.
Both always blocks read old values and schedule updates.
So:
Block1: schedules x = y_old
Block2: schedules z = x_old
Order doesn’t matter at all.
Both read the pre-clock values.

2️⃣ Blocking vs non-blocking interaction between two always blocks
Question
always @(posedge clk)
    x = y;   // blocking

always @(posedge clk)
    z = x;   // blocking


Is there a possible race?
Will z get y or old x?

Answer

Yes, a race condition exists.

The order of execution of the two always blocks is undefined, so:

If block1 executes first → x=y ⇒ block2 sees new x

If block2 executes first → sees old x (race)

Never mix blocking assignments between two clocked always block
6️⃣What is wrong with this?

always @(*) begin
    if (en)
        q = d;
end
Answer:Latch inferred because q is not assigned when en = 0.

7️⃣ Race condition when multiple drivers exist
Question
always @(posedge clk) x <= a;
always @(posedge clk) x <= b;
What happens?
Answer
Illegal — multiple drivers to same register.
Synthesis error.
9️⃣ What does this Verilog slice mean?
5️⃣ Difference between these slices
a = x[5:2];
a = x[2 +: 4];
a = x[5 -: 4];
Answer:
[5:2] → bits 5,4,3,2
[2 +: 4] → start=2, width=4 → 5:2
[5 -: 4] → start=5, width=4 → 5:2
All three same result.

3️⃣ Does order of always blocks matter in synthesis?
Answer:
No. RTL describes hardware. Synthesis does not consider ordering.
Only simulation ordering differs.
4️⃣ Why is the following code bad in hardware design?
always @(*) begin
    a = b + c;
    b = a + d;
end
Answer:
Creates a combinational feedback loop → unstable, non-synthesizable.

⭐⭐⭐ L3 – Hardcore (Qualcomm DSP / Nvidia GPU / AMD CPU level)
1️⃣ Describe how non-blocking assignments are scheduled in Verilog simulation.
Events go through:
Active Region
Inactive Region
NBA Region
Monitor Region
Registers update in NBA, guaranteeing simultaneity.

2️⃣ You have two sequential always blocks. Can their simulation order change the design?
Example:
always @(posedge clk) a <= b;
always @(posedge clk) b <= a;

Answer:No race.
Because both use non-blocking, so order doesn’t matter.
Hardware = two flip-flops swapping values every cycle.

4️⃣ What is a combinational cycle in RTL? Give an example and explain why it breaks STA.
Example:
assign x = y + 1;
assign y = x + 1;

Hardware cannot converge.
STA cannot compute a stable delay.

6️⃣ DSP-style multiply-accumulate race question
always @(posedge clk)
    acc <= acc + (a * b);

Why might this fail timing?

Answer:
Because (a*b) is large combinational logic.
Critical path = multiply → add → register.

Fix using pipelining:
always @(posedge clk) mul <= a*b;
always @(posedge clk) acc <= acc + mul;

8️⃣ Why should you avoid huge case statements in combinational logic?
Because:
synthesizes into deep mux tree
huge delay
poor timing
area explosion
possible latch inference if cases incomplete

9️⃣ What does this Verilog slice mean?
📦 Example
Let:ACCW = 16, i = 3
Expression becomes:
acc_in_flat[3*16 +: 16] = acc_in_flat[48 +: 16]
Which means: acc_in_flat[63:48]
