A GPU is  a SIMD (SIMT) machine, except it's not programmed using SIMD instruction.
It's programmed using threads (SPMD programming model)
Each thread executes the same code but on a different piece of data.
Each thread has its own context.
A set of threads executing the same instruction are grouped as WARPS.
A WARP is a SIMD operation formed by Hardware
