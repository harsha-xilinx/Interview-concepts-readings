Multi-Processor
---------------
A multiprocessor system is a computer system that has two or more processors (CPUs) sharing the same physical memory and connected through a common interconnect or bus.
In simpler terms:
Multiple CPUs working together within a single system to execute tasks faster, more efficiently, or in parallel.

🧠 Why Use Multiprocessors?
	•	Performance: Multiple CPUs can execute different parts of a program or multiple programs at once (parallelism).
	•	Scalability: System performance scales with added processors.
	•	Reliability: Some designs provide fault tolerance — if one processor fails, others continue.
	•	Specialization: Certain processors can be optimized for specific tasks (e.g., graphics, signal processing)

⚙️ 1. Architecture Types of Multiprocessor Systems

A. Shared Memory Multiprocessors (Tightly Coupled)
All processors share a common main memory.
Key traits:
	•	All CPUs have access to the same memory space.
	•	Communication occurs through shared variables.
	•	Synchronization is achieved using locks or semaphores.

Examples:
	•	Modern multicore CPUs (Intel, AMD, ARM big.LITTLE)
	•	SMP (Symmetric Multiprocessing) servers

B. Distributed Memory Multiprocessors (Loosely Coupled)
Each processor has its own private memory, and processors communicate via a network (message passing).
Examples:
	•	Cluster computing (Beowulf, HPC systems)
	•	Supercomputers using MPI (Message Passing Interface)


Type                                                Description                                                    Example
Asymmetric Multiprocessing (AMP)           One master CPU controls others                                   Older embedded systems
Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP)           All CPUs are peers; share memory equally                          Modern x86/ARM servers
Massively Parallel Processing (MPP)       Many independent CPUs, each with its own memory                   Supercomputers, GPUs
Heterogeneous Multiprocessing (HMP)      Different types of cores (e.g., performance + efficiency)          ARM big.LITTLE, SoCs

🧠 4. Memory Consistency and Coherence

Shared-memory multiprocessors face coherence challenges — multiple CPUs caching the same data must stay synchronized.
	•	Cache Coherence Protocols (e.g., MESI, MOESI)
	•	Ensure all processors see consistent values.
	•	Memory Consistency Models
	•	Define when updates to shared memory become visible (e.g., sequential, relaxed).

🧾 5. Software Support
	•	Operating Systems must handle:
	•	CPU scheduling across cores
	•	Synchronization primitives (mutex, semaphores)
	•	Interrupt handling per CPU
	•	Programming Models:
	•	Shared memory: OpenMP, pthreads
	•	Distributed memory: MPI
	•	Hybrid: CUDA (for GPUs), OpenCL
