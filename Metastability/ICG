What is Integrated Clock Gating (ICG)?
Integrated Clock Gating is a power-saving technique used in digital ICs where the clock to a block is turned OFF when the block is idle.
Instead of manually coding clock-gating logic with AND/OR gates, a dedicated standard-cell called an ICG cell is used.

Integrated Clock Gating is a power optimization technique — not a CDC solution — but careless use can introduce CDC problems.

Why use an ICG cell?
A raw gate on a clock can cause glitches and timing issues.

An ICG cell includes:
A level-sensitive latch (usually negative-level)
A clock gate (AND / OR)
Optional scan enable
This ensures the enable signal is sampled safely when the clock is LOW, preventing glitches.

Why Integrated Clock Gating is important
🔋 Reduces dynamic power (clock toggles consume a lot of power)
🧠 Safe clock gating (glitch-free)
🧪 DFT-friendly (scan enable support)
🛠️ Preferred by synthesis & PnR tools

Example (RTL intent – synthesis inserts ICG)
always @(posedge clk)
  if (en)
    q <= d;
👉 Synthesis may infer an ICG cell automatically.

Is Integrated Clock Gating related to CDC?
🚫 Directly? NO
ICG is not a CDC technique.
| Aspect                | ICG             | CDC                          |
| --------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Purpose               | Power reduction | Safe clock-domain crossing   |
| Deals with            | Clock enabling  | Data transfer between clocks |
| Handles metastability | ❌ No            | ✅ Yes                        |

Q1: Is a gated clock considered a new clock domain?
✔️ Yes, for STA and CDC tools.

Q2: Can clock gating cause CDC violations?
✔️ Yes, indirectly.

Q3: Should you gate clocks in RTL manually?
❌ No — let synthesis insert ICG.

Q4: What happens if enable toggles when clock is HIGH?
✔️ ICG latch prevents glitches.



Question:
1️⃣ “Clock gating is just ANDing clock with enable”
❌ Trap answer:
Yes, gated_clk = clk & enable.
✅ Correct:
Never gate clocks with logic gates.
This causes glitches, race conditions, and STA violations.
✔️ Always use ICG (Integrated Clock Gating) cells with a latch.


4️⃣ “Enable can come from any clock domain”
❌ Trap answer:
Enable is just control, not data.
✅ Correct:
If enable comes from another clock domain →
⚠️ Metastability inside the ICG latch.
✔️ Enable must be synchronized into the source clock domain.

8️⃣ “Clock gating has no impact on timing”
❌ Trap answer:
It only affects power.
✅ Correct:
Clock gating:
Adds clock latency
Adds clock uncertainty
Can create skew imbalance
✔️ STA must analyze gated clocks separately.

Q: Can clock gating cause hold violations?
✔️ Yes (due to skew changes)

Q. Clock gating saves power everywhere ?
Clock gating does NOT save power everywhere.
It saves power only when the gated block is large and idle long enough
P = α · C · V² · f

❌ When clock gating is NOT beneficial
1️⃣ Small logic blocks

Few flops
Small clock tree
➡️ ICG overhead > saved power

Q, 6️⃣ “Clock gating is better than clock enable” ?
Clock gating is not “better” than clock enable — it is more powerful but riskier.
🧠 Final Golden Summary
Use clock enable by default. Use clock gating only when power savings clearly justify the added clocking complexity.

Q: Why not always use clock gating instead of CE?
✔️ Because clock gating increases CDC, STA, reset, and verification complexity.

Q: Can clock enable achieve same power as clock gating?
✔️ No — clock tree still toggles.

Q: Why do many CPUs prefer CE inside pipeline stages?
✔️ Simpler timing + fewer CDC issues.
