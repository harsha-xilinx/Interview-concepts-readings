** STA question, can a timing path have setup violation but no hold time violation ?
Yes — a timing path can absolutely have a setup violation but no hold time violation.
Setup and Hold analyze opposite timing extremes:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Check     | What it cares about            | Violated when              | Fixed by                        |
| --------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Setup** | **Max delay** (slow data path) | Data arrives **too late**  | Speed up data / slow down clock |
| **Hold**  | **Min delay** (fast data path) | Data arrives **too early** | Add delay to data path          |

Therefore:
A path can easily be:
Too slow → fails setup
But still not too fast → passes hold

✔ Why They Are Independent
Setup and hold depend on different parameters:
Setup depends on:
Logic delay (max)
Clock skew (launch early, capture late)
Clock period

Hold depends on:
Logic delay (min)
Clock skew (launch late, capture early)
No dependence on clock period
So adjusting the clock period affects setup but does not affect hold.

📌 Common Real-World Scenario

Imagine:
You increase the clock frequency (reduce period)
Suddenly setup fails
But hold is still fine because min delay did not change
This is one of the most common STA situations

** can a timing path have hold time violation but no setup time violation ?
Yes — a timing path can have a hold time violation but no setup time violation.
This also happens very often in STA.

*** in STA, can we update hold violation without changing data path ?
