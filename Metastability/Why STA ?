🔥🔥🔥🔥Anyway we do check our stimulus going correct, and giving proper output or not in Simulation then why do we need Static timing analysis ?
Answer: 
That's a great question! While simulation (specifically, Dynamic Timing Analysis - DTA) is essential for verifying the functionality of your design with specific inputs, 
you still need Static Timing Analysis (STA) primarily because:

1. 🚀 Speed and Scalability (Exhaustiveness)
Simulation (DTA) is Slow: In DTA, you run a simulation for a set of test vectors (input stimuli). 
For a complex chip with millions of gates, the number of possible input combinations is astronomically large. 
It would take an impractical amount of time to simulate every single functional and timing scenario that could lead to a timing violation.

STA is Fast and Exhaustive: STA is a mathematical, input-independent analysis. 
It breaks the design down into all possible timing paths (from a clock source to a register, or register-to-register, etc.) and calculates the delay along each path to check against timing constraints (like setup and hold times) under worst-case and best-case conditions. 
Since it doesn't need to simulate logical operation for millions of test vectors, it's exponentially faster and checks every single path in the design, guaranteeing 100% path coverage for timing.

2. 🔍 Path Coverage
Simulation (DTA) is Incomplete: DTA can only check the timing of the paths that are logically sensitized (activated) by the specific input test vectors you provide. If a critical timing path is never activated by your test bench, a severe timing error could go undetected, leading to silicon failure.

STA is Complete: STA checks all possible physical paths, regardless of whether they are logically activatable or not. It systematically finds the worst-case delay (critical path) for setup checks (max delay violation) and the best-case delay for hold checks (min delay violation)
