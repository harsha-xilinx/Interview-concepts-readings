Can you make a 2 day quick and effective learning plan for me about DMC ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Perfect, Harsh — since you already understand digital design and AXI basics, we can build an intensive 2-day plan to give you both theory clarity and practical understanding of the Dynamic Memory Controller (DMC).

This plan is structured for maximum comprehension + hardware context, useful for FPGA/SoC engineers or interviews in HFT or semiconductor firms.

⚡ Day 1 — Core Understanding (Architecture + Protocol Awareness)
🎯 Goal:

Grasp what a DMC does, its internal submodules, and how it interacts with AXI and DDR PHYs.

⏰ Duration: ~6–7 hours total
1. Morning (2 hours) — Fundamentals

Topics

What is DRAM and why it needs a controller

DRAM hierarchy: channel → rank → bank → row → column

Basic DRAM commands (ACT, READ, WRITE, PRE, REF)

Timing parameters (tRCD, tRP, tRAS, tFAW, tWR, tREFI)

Resources

Micron DDR4 datasheet (skim first 20 pages)

YouTube: “DRAM Basics for FPGA Engineers” (any 20–30 min lecture)

JEDEC DDR4 command sequence overview (diagram form)

2. Midday (2 hours) — DMC Architecture

Topics

DMC pipeline: AXI → Command Interface → Scheduler → PHY

Submodules: address mapper, scheduler, timing engine, refresh unit

AXI transaction to DDR command flow

Open-page vs close-page policy

Resources

ARM DMC-620 Technical Overview (focus on block-level diagram)

Xilinx MIG (Memory Interface Generator) User Guide — read "Architecture Overview"

Use the diagram we created earlier to visualize flow.

3. Evening (2–3 hours) — Interface Deep Dive

Topics

AXI transaction mapping: bursts, read/write channels

DFI (DDR PHY Interface) signals overview (DFI 5.0 basic concepts)

How timing engine enforces JEDEC constraints

Refresh & power-down handling

Practical Exercise

Draw a timing diagram of: AXI write → DMC command sequence → DDR signals

Use any simulation tool (e.g., ModelSim) to look at an AXI-DDR example waveform (from Xilinx MIG testbench).

⚙️ Day 2 — Intermediate to Advanced (Scheduling + RTL Thinking)
🎯 Goal:

Understand how real DMCs optimize performance, and how you’d design one in RTL.

⏰ Duration: ~6–8 hours total
1. Morning (2 hours) — Scheduling and Performance

Topics

Command scheduler algorithms: FCFS, bank interleaving, QoS-aware scheduling

Reordering logic: how DMC improves throughput

Bank open/close policy and row-hit optimization

Exercise

Write pseudocode for a simple DMC scheduler FSM.

Resources

Synopsys DDR Controller whitepaper (read section on command scheduling)

ARM “QoS in DMC-620” application note (if available online)

2. Midday (2–3 hours) — RTL and Verification Mindset

Topics

DMC RTL design blocks (FSMs, buffers, timing counters)

Integration with AXI interconnect and DDR PHY

Verification strategy using DDR models (e.g., Micron Verilog model)

Exercise

Sketch block-level RTL connections (AXI → FIFOs → Scheduler → PHY).

Write a small Verilog skeleton for scheduler.v or refresh_controller.v.

3. Evening (2–3 hours) — Advanced/Practical Layer

Topics

Coherency (CHI → DMC via interconnects)

ECC and RAS integration (Error detection, scrubbing)

LPDDR vs DDR5 differences at controller level

Real-world tuning (latency vs throughput tradeoffs)

Resources

ARM DMC whitepaper or Cadence DDR Controller product brief

Optional: Watch “DDR Controller Architecture Deep Dive” (YouTube: VLSI/ASIC design channels)

🎯 End of Day 2 — Deliverables

By the end, you should be able to:
✅ Explain how AXI transactions map to DDR commands
✅ Draw and label the DMC datapath from memory request to DRAM
✅ Describe scheduler and refresh mechanisms in your own words
✅ Write pseudocode or partial RTL for command arbitration
✅ Confidently discuss timing and PHY integration in interviews
