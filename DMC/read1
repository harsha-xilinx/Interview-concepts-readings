So, inputs to DMC will be AXI/CHI only correct
🧩 1. The Short Answer

✅ Yes, the DMC typically receives AXI, AHB, or CHI transactions — depending on the system architecture and generation of the interconnect.

It doesn’t receive raw memory commands directly (like ACT, READ, WRITE).
Instead, it takes high-level read/write transactions and translates them into DDR command sequences internally.

| Input Protocol                                  | Common Use                     | Description                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AXI4 (Advanced eXtensible Interface)**        | Most common in modern SoCs     | 5-channel protocol used between CPU/DMAs and the memory controller. Almost all FPGA DMC IPs (Xilinx, Intel, etc.) use AXI4. |
| **AHB (Advanced High-performance Bus)**         | Legacy or simpler systems      | Simpler, non-burst protocol. Found in older microcontrollers or embedded SoCs.                                              |
| **CHI (Coherent Hub Interface)**                | ARMv8.2+ / Neoverse-class SoCs | Used in coherent interconnects. The DMC integrates with CHI through a **coherent bridge** (e.g., CMN-700 → DMC-620).        |
| **Native Interface (Custom Command Interface)** | Rare / custom RTL DMCs         | Some simple DMCs have a custom “read/write” handshake instead of a bus. Used in FPGA test designs.                          |

⚙️ 3. Internal Translation Path (AXI → DDR)

Inside the DMC, this happens:

AXI/CHI Interface
       ↓
Command Decoder / Address Mapper
       ↓
Scheduler / Timing Engine
       ↓
DFI Interface (DDR PHY)
       ↓
DDR Device

So:
The input side (AXI/CHI) deals with memory transactions.
The output side (DFI/PHY) deals with electrical DDR commands.


🧠 3. DMC Front-End (Protocol Layer)
Role:

The front-end receives memory requests from masters over AXI or other interconnects.

Key Operations:

Command Queueing: AXI requests are queued, reordered, and prioritized.

Address Decoding: Logical addresses are translated to Bank, Row, Column addresses.

Transaction Splitting: Large bursts may be split to align with DRAM row/column boundaries.

QoS Management: Handles multiple masters with priority and bandwidth control.


⚙️ 4. DMC Back-End (Scheduler + Command Generator)
Role:

Schedules DRAM commands according to timing rules and memory state.

Key Operations:

Command Scheduling

Issues ACTIVATE → READ/WRITE → PRECHARGE sequences.

Ensures timing constraints like tRCD, tRP, tFAW, and tRRD.

Row Management

Tracks open rows per bank.

Implements open-page or close-page policies.

Command Encoding

Converts abstract requests into JEDEC-standard commands (ACT, RD, WR, PRE, REF).

⚡ 5. DFI Interface (DMC ↔ DDR PHY)
DFI (DDR PHY Interface)

A standardized interface between the controller and PHY (Physical Layer).
It carries:

Command Bus: ACT, RD, WR, PRE, REF

Address/Bank Bus: Row/Column/Bank addresses

Control Signals: CS, RAS, CAS, WE, ODT, CKE

Data Interface: Write data and read data strobes (DQ/DQS)

Example Timing:

When a READ command is issued:
Cycle N   : Controller drives ACTIVATE (Row)
Cycle N+tRCD : Controller drives READ with column address
Cycle N+tRCD+tCL : Data is returned on DQ lines from DRAM


🔌 6. DDR PHY (Physical Layer)
Role:

Converts DFI signals into actual DDR electrical signals that drive the memory devices.

Key Responsibilities:

Serialization/Deserialization (SerDes) for data paths

Clocking and Delay Calibration (DLL/PLL)

Training and Leveling (write leveling, read leveling, DQS gating)

Timing Alignment between DQS (strobe) and DQ (data)

Signals Driven:

DQ: Data lines (bidirectional)

DQS: Data strobe for timing alignment

ADDR, BA, RAS#, CAS#, WE#: Address/Command lines

CK/CK#: Differential clock to DRAM
