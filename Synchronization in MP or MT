✅ What Is Synchronization?
Synchronization is the set of techniques used to ensure that multiple threads or processes access shared resources safely and execute in the correct order.
Shared resources include:
Variables / memory
Files
Databases
I/O devices
Data structures (lists, queues, buffers, etc.)
Without synchronization, simultaneous access can cause unpredictable and incorrect behavior. 

🔥 Why Do We Need Synchronization?
1. To Prevent Race Conditions

A race condition happens when two threads/processes try to access or modify shared data at the same time, causing inconsistent results.

Example without sync:
Thread A: balance = balance + 10
Thread B: balance = balance + 20
If both read the old balance before either writes it, updates are lost.

2. To Avoid Data Corruption
When multiple threads write to shared memory or files without coordination, the data can become corrupted or invalid.

3. To Ensure Consistent Program Behavior
Synchronization ensures predictability. Without it, thread execution order becomes random, leading to intermittent bugs (“heisenbugs”).

4. To Coordinate Activities Between Threads/Processes
Sometimes one task must wait for another to complete.
Example:
Thread A produces data
Thread B consumes it
You use mechanisms like semaphores or condition variables.

5. To Provide Mutual Exclusion (Safety)
Mutual exclusion ensures only one thread accesses a critical section at a time.


🧰 Common Synchronization Mechanisms
For both multiprocessing and multithreading:
Mutex / Lock
Semaphore
Monitor / Condition Variable
Event
Barrier
Read-Write Lock
 Special mention for multiprocessing:
 Inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms:
 Shared memory + locks
 Message queues
 Pipes
 Signals
